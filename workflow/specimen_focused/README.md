## Start the analysis
Run data_preprocessing.R.ipynb to reorganize some of the data and optionally run Run exploratory_analysis.R.ipynb to understand this dataset.

## Run the main analysis
The main analyses have been broken down into 4 separate folders (`cd_only`, `cd_versus_uc`, `comprehensive` and `uc_only`. Each folder is analyzing a particular subset of data as indicated by the name.
